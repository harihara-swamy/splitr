## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To install Splitr, first clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Begin by setting up the backend: install the necessary dependencies using a package manager, then create a `.env` file to configure your MongoDB URI, server port, and JWT secret key. Once configured, start the backend server. Next, move to the frontend directory, install its dependencies, and launch the development server. After both servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To use Splitr, ensure both the backend and frontend servers are running. Open the application in your browser and log in or register for a new account. After logging in, you can create a group, add members, and start recording shared expenses. The system will automatically calculate individual shares, track who owes whom, and update balances in real-time. Users can view summaries, settle up payments, and manage all group expenses from a single, intuitive dashboard.
